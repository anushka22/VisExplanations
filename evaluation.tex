\section{Examples}
Data characteristics

Visually interesting patterns -- scagnostics (works for different ones)
Different -- Can it pick out ``confounding variates" such as those that cause Simpson's Paradox?
support -- small n (ourworld.csv) vs large n. small -> inside distributions so we'll be more conservation in judgements of "real" patterns
number splits -- State vs Region

\section{Discussion}
Our approach is generalizable..
The wide range of metrics~\cite{Bertini2011} can be used w/ our method to describe the visual pattern of interest to find.

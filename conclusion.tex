\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we described a method for automatically ranking the small multiple displays created by the possible partitioning variables in a data set. Our method can incorporate a wide range of existing quality metrics for different visualization types, making our approach very general. Our use of a permutation test allows our method to detect and discount non-informative or spurious patterns in small multiple displays.

The framework of our approach---non-parametric tests combined with cognostics---is very general and there is much more work to be done.

Launching off point...non-parametric tests such as permutation and bootstrapping have many possible applications in visualization. By further developing the application of these techniques to visualization as well as developing better quality metrics (cognostics) that capture important visual patterns, we can provide visualization users with rich tools that help them explore their data faster and more correctly.

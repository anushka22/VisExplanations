Following the 

splits that are more informative than a random split.
We set up the following goodness-of-split criteria to guide our work:
\begin{itemize}
\item Simplicity:
\item Support: An indicator of the strength of the relationship or visual pattern is the proportion of data points that 
\item Diversity: Robustness to overfitting?
\item Degrees of Freedom:
\end{itemize}

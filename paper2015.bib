abstract ={AutoVis is a data viewer that responds to content–text, relational tables, hierarchies, streams, images–and displays the information appropriately (that is, as an expert would). Its design rests on the grammar of graphics, scagnostics and a modeler based on the logic of statistical analysis. We distinguish an automatic visualization system (AVS) from an automated visualization system. The former automatically makes decisions about what is to be visualized. The latter is a programming system for automating the production of charts, graphs and visualizations. An AVS is designed to provide a first glance at data before modeling and analysis are done. AVS is designed to protect researchers from ignoring missing data, outliers, miscodes and other anomalies that can violate statistical assumptions or otherwise jeopardize the validity of models. The design of this system incorporates several unique features: (1) a spare interface–analysts simply drag a data source into an empty window, (2) a graphics generator that requires no user definitions to produce graphs, (3) a statistical analyzer that protects users from false conclusions, and (4) a pattern recognizer that responds to the aspects (density, shape, trend, and so on) that professional statisticians notice when investigating data sets.},

We propose to furnish visual statistical methods with an inferential framework and protocol, modelled on confirmatory statistical testing. In this framework, plots take on the role of test statistics, and human cognition the role of statistical tests. Statistical significance of {\textquoteleft}discoveries{\textquoteright} is measured by having the human viewer compare the plot of the real dataset with collections of plots of simulated datasets. A simple but rigorous protocol that provides inferential validity is modelled after the {\textquoteleft}lineup{\textquoteright} popular from criminal legal procedures. Another protocol modelled after the {\textquoteleft}Rorschach{\textquoteright} inkblot test, well known from (pop-)psychology, will help analysts acclimatize to random variability before being exposed to the plot of the real data. The proposed protocols will be useful for exploratory data analysis, with reference datasets simulated by using a null assumption that structure is absent. The framework is also useful for model diagnostics in which case reference datasets are simulated from the model in question. This latter point follows up on previous proposals. Adopting the protocols will mean an adjustment in working procedures for data analysts, adding more rigour, and teachers might find that incorporating these protocols into the curriculum improves their students{\textquoteright} statistical~thinking.

Visual Explanations...

Multivariate explanations as a worldview task~\cite{Amar2004} often not supported by visualization tools. However, their definition is limited in scope to correlation models involving more than two measures...

In particular, we propose a selection method for :
\begin{itemize}
    \item .
    \item     \item Comparisons between adjacent bars in the same stack have much higher error than non-adjacent comparisons. We speculate that this is due to a bias towards making part-of-whole comparisons. 
\end{itemize}

The next section summarizes related work on visual explanations for multivariate data analysis. This is followed by a description of the method we propose and discussion of metrics we use. Then Finally, we draw conclusions from this research and outline future work.

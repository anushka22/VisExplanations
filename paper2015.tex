%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is
%% in the conference process. ``review'' and ``widereview'' are for review
%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier. Further, ``electronic'' includes
%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page
%% of the journal version.  Figures should begin on the second page and be
%% in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour shifting may occur
%% during the printing process.  Papers submitted with figures other than the optional teaser on the
%% first page will be refused.

%% These three lines bring in essential packages: ``mathptmx'' for Type 1
%% typefaces, ``graphicx'' for inclusion of EPS figures. and ``times''
%% for proper handling of the times font family.

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
Faceting/Partitioning a data view is a useful, easily interpretable multivariate display technique (trellis).
Selecting a variable to partition a view such that it provides a visual explanation for the structure seen in the large single view is expensive/hard given high-dimensional datasets and limited prior research. 
We describe a set of goodness criteria for splits resulting from using a particular variable to partition the original view into a set of facets. 
Then we propose an algorithm for applying these criteria to select interesting partitions and evaluate the approach on a few real world datasets.

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
%Small multiple displays are a common approach for visualizing multidimensional data.
Effective small multiple displays are created by partitioning a visualization on variables that reveal interesting conditional structure in the data.
%If the number of variables in the data set is large, or if the analyst has limited prior information about the data set, choosing an informative partitioning variable can require substantial trial and error.
We propose a method that automatically ranks the possible partitioning variables in a data set, allowing analysts to focus on the most promising small multiple displays.
Our approach is based on a randomized, non-parametric permutation test, which allows us to handle a wide range of quality measures for visual patterns defined on many different visualization types, while discounting spurious patterns.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on scatterplots of real-world, multidimensional datasets.

On the right is the top ranked small multiple display automatically picked by our algorithm to help explain the input data. It partitions the data on admit ACT scores, revealing that for universities with very high average ACT scores, there is a strong linear relationship between the two selected variables, while for other universities, there is no clear relationship.}
